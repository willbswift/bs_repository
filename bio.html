						The first thing one needs to understand about me is that I love stories – fantastical mind expanding stories.  Stories that poke the emotions and blow the mind are my favorite (so Speculative Fiction, in general and Science Fiction in detail).  I like to find my brain and expectations challenged and norms subverted.  I love stories with mystery and unexplained elements that are rationalized through the process of the protagonists grappling with the problem.  I enjoy a solidly structured plot but will put up with a silly one if it takes my mind somewhere interesting.

						The exception to the ‘mind over emotion’ story seems to be stories of sacrifice for intense friendship and family.  I’m especially drawn to stories about found and forged families (rather than biological families).  Romance is obviously one such example but it tends to be the one I’m least interested in.  My reactions to these stories is all together much more primal and emotional, and I find it much harder to explain exactly why I enjoy them.
